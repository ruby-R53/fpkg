March 25 - April 8, 2024:
- Version 2.0.0 is out already!
- Improved error handling some more
- Changed 'add' and 'delete' actions to take the package
  name as an argument
- Added 'edit':
  - You can now edit a package's .ii using your editor
    (defined in $EDITOR)
  - Should I make it able to edit the package name and
    directory as well?
- Added some functions in the code so that it doesn't get
  redundant
- Fixed a silly typo
  - Figure out what it was and get a cake :)
- Added 'peek': you can now just look at a package's .ii
- Added 'goto': you can now change to a package's
  directory for a moment instead of typing its whole path
- fpkg can now update git repos with submodules properly!
  - Not sure if my implementation of it is crap though...
- Changed how 'install' works
  - The first line of the .ii's now start with
    'cd <pkg>/' instead of 'cd ../<pkg>/', change your
	.ii's accordingly!
