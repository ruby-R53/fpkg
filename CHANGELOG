May 17, 2024:
- Version 2.1.1 is out!
  - Finally using that last number for something...
  - Just an improvement on the formatting at the 
    'add' section of the code
  - fpkg itself now already goes to the package's
    directory, the 'cd' on the .ii's is now not
	required! Change your .ii's accordingly!
- Still have to figure out how to do the stuff I
  put on the TODO list...

April 28, 2024:
- Version 2.1.0 is out!
- The package manager is stupid, and that's because I am
  stupid.
  - Fixed the 'add' command: it checks the argument
    better now, and can add the package properly.
	See the diff :)
  - Added command 'remove': now fpkg is able to uninstall
  	packages too! Update your .ii's accordingly now!
- Improved 'goto'
  - fpkg will now use a new .bashrc for its shell. Add
    the new .bashrc to $FPKGDIR!
- Added a TODO file
  - So that I can write down stuff I could implement one
    day

March 25 - April 8, 2024:
- Version 2.0.0 is out already!
- Improved error handling some more
- Changed 'add' and 'delete' actions to take the package
  name as an argument
- Added 'edit':
  - You can now edit a package's .ii using your editor
    (defined in $EDITOR)
  - Should I make it able to edit the package name and
    directory as well?
- Added some functions in the code so that it doesn't get
  redundant
- Fixed a silly typo
  - Figure out what it was and get a cake :)
- Added 'peek': you can now just look at a package's .ii
- Added 'goto': you can now change to a package's
  directory for a moment instead of typing its whole path
- fpkg can now update git repos with submodules properly!
  - Not sure if my implementation of it is crap though...
- Changed how 'install' works
  - The first line of the .ii's now start with
    'cd <pkg>/' instead of 'cd ../<pkg>/', change your
	.ii's accordingly!

    the program that much
