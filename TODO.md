Stuff I'm thinking of implementing one day:

- A more sophisticated format for each
  packages' needs.
  - A lot of repositories can only be
    updated with rebase, while other don't,
	so I have to think of how to handle
	that in a less messy way.

- A helper script for installing?
  - I've been considering it for a while,
    I think it might be a better way of
	new users to start off.

- That's it for now :)
