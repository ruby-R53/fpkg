Stuff I'm thinking of implementing one day:

- Actually being able to get packages from non-git sources
  - Maybe I can get an idea of how to implement that by checking
    out how PKGBUILDs work...

- Logging, so that the user can track down when a build fails
  - UPDATE (2024/5/30): working on it! For now it's a pretty
    barebones implementation of it, but hey, it works!
  - UPDATE (2024/6/25): how to improve it lol

- Commit history support, so that the user doesn't see only
  the latest commit on the package
  - UPDATE (2024/5/30): working on that one too, but first I
    really had to fix that handling of `git log` lmao
  - UPDATE (2024/5/31): implemented! I'm thinking of making
    git's pretty format customizable too, not really sure

- That's it for now :)
