Stuff I'm thinking of implementing one day:
- Logging, so that the user can track down when a build fails
- Dependency checking - I'm really unsure of how I would
  implement that, though!
- Commit history support, so that the user doesn't see only
  the latest commit on the package
- That's it for now :)
