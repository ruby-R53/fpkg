Stuff I'm thinking of implementing one day:

- Logging, so that the user can track down when a build fails
  - UPDATE (2024/5/30): working on it! For now it's a pretty
    barebones implementation of it, but hey, it works!

- Dependency checking - I'm really unsure of how I would
  implement that one, though!
  - UPDATE (2024/5/30): I'm thinking of removing this one
    from the list. I have no idea on how to do it.

- Commit history support, so that the user doesn't see only
  the latest commit on the package
  - UPDATE (2024/5/30): working on that one too, but first I
    really had to fix that handling of `git log` lmao
  - UPDATE (2024/5/31): implemented! I'm thinking of making
    git's pretty format customizable too, not really sure

- Insert each registered package in alphabetical order so
  that pkg.list and related look prettier
  - UPDATE (2024/5/30): I'm thinking of removing this one
    from the list too. It's just for appearance anyway.

- That's it for now :)
